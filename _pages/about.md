I'm a pragmatic ML Engineer with 5 years of experience, specialising in leveraging data science to address real-world challenges across commercial, financial, and customer service domains. My core competencies revolve around developing solutions in recommender systems, NLP, and MLOps.

Examples of my work:

* Blended user preferences and item popularity vectors to address the shortcomings of popularity-centric recommendations, resulting in a 600% surge in unique recommended items on the A/B test and a monthly profit uplift of Â£11K.

* Deduplicated grouped items with high similarities in product names and images, leading to a reduction in the duplication rate (13% â†’ 2%) and unanimous positive feedback in a customer survey regarding the recommendation quality.

* Designed recommendation modules from training and evaluation to serving in an MLOps environment, ensuring versatile applicability across diverse models and business domains and streamlined service operations.

Technical Skills: Python | PyTorch | TensorFlow | HuggingFace | LLM | PySpark | Elasticsearch | Airflow | MLflow | MLOps | Docker.

In pursuit of continually enhancing my research and academic knowledge, I recently undertook an MSc in Computing (AI & ML) at Imperial College London.
